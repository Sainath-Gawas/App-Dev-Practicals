EXP 9 includes two mobile applications developed using local database integration with SQLite. The first app is a Calculator built with Flutter, which performs basic arithmetic operations and also stores calculation history using SQLite for offline access. The second app is a ToDo List developed in React Native, where users can add, update, and delete tasks, with all data persistently stored in an SQLite database. These projects demonstrate local data handling.

EXP 10 includes two applications showcasing Firebase integration.
Calculator (Flutter + Firebase): A simple calculator app built using Flutter, enhanced with Firebase for storing and syncing calculation history.
ToDo App (React Native + Firebase): A task management app developed in React Native, using Firestore Firebase database for real-time task storage and user management.

EXP 11 includes "Today in History – India"
